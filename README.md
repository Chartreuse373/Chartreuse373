## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm @Chartreuse373 / Jack Nolan. Welcome to my page!
- I've been working as a Data Analyst since graduating in 2023
- All my code from work is in a private repo, but I currently treat all public repos on my page as a portfolio of sorts, so feel free to peruse!
- I currently do most of my work in R and SQL, but also have experience in Python, Tableau, and PowerBI and am always looking to expand and strengthen my skillset
- Similarly, find both my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-nolan-b79b3a274/) and public [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jack.nolan/vizzes) here!
- If you have any inquiries, feel free to reach out at jack.nolan373@gmail.com
